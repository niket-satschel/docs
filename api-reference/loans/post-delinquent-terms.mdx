openapi: 'POST /delinquent-terms'
---

This endpoint updates the delinquent amount and delinquent days for a loan without changing its overall status. It is used to track and maintain accurate delinquency metrics for reporting, risk assessment, and portfolio management purposes. Unlike marking a loan as delinquent, this endpoint only updates the financial and temporal aspects of the delinquency.

**What it does:**
- Updates the delinquent_amount field for the specified loan
- Updates the delinquent_days field to reflect current arrears duration
- Records the delinquency terms update on-chain for audit trail
- Maintains loan status while refreshing delinquency metrics

**When to use it:**
- When delinquent amounts change due to partial payments or additional fees
- To update the number of days a loan has been in arrears
- For periodic reconciliation of delinquency data without status changes
- As part of automated portfolio monitoring and reporting workflows

**Prerequisites:**
- The loan must have been funded to the borrower, OR
- The loan repayment process must be in progress
- This endpoint cannot be called on loans that are still in underwriting or approval stages

}
```

## Notes on Delinquent Terms Updates

- This endpoint updates delinquency metrics without changing the loan's primary status or triggering state transitions.
- The `amount` field represents the total outstanding delinquent amount, including principal, interest, and any applicable fees.
- The `days` field tracks the cumulative number of days the loan has been in arrears since the first missed payment.
- These updates are recorded on-chain to maintain an immutable audit trail of delinquency progression for regulatory and risk management purposes.
