title: 'Acknowledge Payment'
openapi: 'POST /acknowledge-payment'
---

This endpoint acknowledges the receipt and successful validation of a **payment** made against a loan. It is typically called by the platform, servicer, or payment processor after confirming the associated transaction on-chain or via off-chain reconciliation mechanisms.

## What it does
- Confirms that a previously submitted **payment** has been received and verified
- Logs the **payment confirmation** for audit and recordkeeping
- Advances the loan status in the **payment lifecycle**

## When to use it
- After verifying a **payment** via blockchain event or payment gateway
- To ensure that the payment tied to a specific **reference ID** is officially recorded
- Before moving forward with next steps like **closing the loan** or triggering **payment-related notifications**


## Request Body

The request body must include the loan identifier and the **payment reference ID**:

```json
{
  "loanId": "0x5a0c0663a48e3abf16c7f0ee632b57da833e44e02a290fc0920ea2858da31f73",
  "refId": "ref123"
}
```

- `loanId`: The unique identifier of the loan.

- `refId`: The reference ID used in the original repayment transaction (loan-repay).

## Response

```json
{
  "transactionHash": "0x5a0c0663a48e3abf16c7f0ee632b57da833e44e02a290fc0920ea2858da31f73"
