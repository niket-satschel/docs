title: 'Complete Underwriting'
openapi: 'POST /complete-underwriting'
---

This endpoint marks the underwriting process as complete for a loan. It finalizes the internal risk evaluation and records the outcomeâ€”whether the loan has been approved or rejected. The decision is logged on-chain to maintain transparency and auditability.

**What it does:**
- Completes the underwriting workflow for a given loan
- Records the final underwriting decision (`approved` or `rejected`)
- Updates the loan status accordingly on-chain

**When to use it:**
- After all underwriting checks, scoring, and risk assessments are complete
- To finalize eligibility and approval before requesting collateral
- As a trigger for moving the loan to the next step in the lifecycle

## Request Body

The request body must include the loan identifier and the underwriting decision:

```json
{
  "loanId": "0x5a0c0663a48e3abf16c7f0ee632b57da833e44e02a290fc0920ea2858da31f73",
  "approved": true
}
```

- `loanId`: The unique identifier of the loan.

- `approved`: A boolean indicating the final underwriting decision (true for approval, false for rejection).

## Response

- Returns a success confirmation with the blockchain transaction hash:

```json
{
  "transactionHash": "0x5a0c0663a48e3abf16c7f0ee632b57da833e44e02a290fc0920ea2858da31f73"
}
