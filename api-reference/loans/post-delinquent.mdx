title: 'Delinquent Loan'
openapi: 'POST /delinquent'
---

This endpoint marks a loan as delinquent when a scheduled repayment is missed. A delinquent loan is behind on payments but has not yet reached default. During delinquency, the platform may apply late fees, restrict new drawdowns, and notify the borrower.

**What it does:**
- Updates the loan status to "delinquent"
- Records the delinquency event on-chain
- Captures the outstanding amount and number of delinquent days
- May trigger late-fee assessment and collections workflows

**When to use it:**
- After a borrower misses a scheduled repayment
- While the loan is within the delinquency window before default
- As part of automated collections or risk monitoring

## Request Body

The request body must include the unique identifier of the loan, the outstanding amount in arrears, and the number of days delinquent:

```json
{
  "loanId": "0xc3e531a7f2919b5eb1665daec3f6797b20d0c522fa79b41aaff5c5c0a2453191",
  "amount": 10000,
  "days": 90
}
```

## Response

- Returns a confirmation of success with the blockchain transaction hash:

```json
{
  "transactionHash": "0x652ac7f00ef9292077c46e9c94ab919aa7c301a7baca139f2b3fa15e032c7dfe"
}
```

## Notes on Delinquency and Escalation

- "Delinquent" means the borrower is late on one or more payments but the account has not been classified as defaulted.
- If the number of delinquent days exceeds your configured threshold and the borrower is unable to pay, the loan is typically escalated to default (see `POST /default`). This may initiate recovery actions such as collateral enforcement, account restrictions, and regulatory/reporting procedures as defined by your policy.
