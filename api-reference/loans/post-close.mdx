title: 'Close Loan'
openapi: 'POST /close'
---

This endpoint closes an active loan after all repayment obligations have been fulfilled. It finalizes the loan lifecycle, releases any encumbered collateral, and updates the loan status to "closed" on-chain for transparency and recordkeeping.

**What it does:**
- Confirms completion of the repayment schedule
- Releases any associated collateral held during the loan term
- Marks the loan as closed in the system and on-chain

**When to use it:**
- After the borrower has made the final repayment
- Once the final payment is validated and reconciled
- To formally complete the loan agreement and release collateral

## Request Body

  "refId": "REF123"
}
```

- `loanId`: The unique identifier of the loan to be closed.
