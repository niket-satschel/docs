This endpoint approves and records the collateral deposited by the borrower for a specific loan.

The approval is logged on-chain as part of the secured lending workflow.

**What it does:**
- Confirms that the borrower has deposited the required collateral
- Updates the loan status to reflect collateral approval
- Records the approval on-chain to maintain an immutable audit trail

**When to use it:**
- After receiving and verifying the borrower's collateral deposit
- Prior to disbursing the loan amount
- As part of collateral management and compliance procedures
