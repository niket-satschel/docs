## Request Body

The request must include:

- `loanId`: The unique identifier of the loan.
- `refId`: The repayment reference ID (must match one used in a prior `loan-repay` call).

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/acknowledge-repayment \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \

    "refId": "ref123"
  }'
```
