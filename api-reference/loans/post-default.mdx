title: 'Default Loan'
openapi: 'POST /default'
---

This endpoint marks a loan as defaulted due to non-payment. It is typically triggered when the borrower fails to meet repayment obligations within the allowed grace period. Marking a loan as defaulted may initiate downstream processes such as collateral liquidation, recovery actions, or reporting.

**What it does:**
- Updates the loan status to "defaulted"
- Signals the platform to begin recovery or liquidation processes
- Records the default event immutably on-chain

**When to use it:**
- After the borrower misses scheduled repayments beyond the contractual grace period
- As part of automated delinquency handling logic
- Before initiating collateral enforcement or legal action

## Request Body
