# Welcome to the Loan Service API documentation

## Overview

Our APIs provide secure, programmable access for managing the end-to-end lifecycle of loan servicing.
Built for financial institutions and fintech platforms, they enable you to:

- Create, underwrite, and fund digital loans
- Track repayment schedules and outstanding balances
- Monitor borrower risk and delinquency
- Handle collateral and repayment workflows securely
- Access detailed borrower identity (PII) and credit metadata where applicable

Whether you're building an internal servicing dashboard, integrating with a credit scoring engine, or creating borrower-facing interfaces, our API ensures compliant and secure loan data handling.
