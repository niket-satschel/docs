# Welcome to the LQDTY Chain Loan Servicing API

## Overview

The **LQDTY Chain** offers a decentralized, transparent, and programmable infrastructure for managing the complete lifecycle of digital loans. Designed for financial institutions, fintechs, and service providers, this API enables secure interactions across various stages of a loan — from application to repayment and beyond.

Our loan servicing protocol is powered by smart contracts and NFT-based representations, ensuring automation, auditability, and compliance across all participants.

## What You Can Do with This API

With this suite of APIs, developers can:

- Submit and manage digital loan applications
- Trigger and track underwriting, document verification, and approval workflows
- Request and validate collateral
- Disburse funds securely on-chain
- Monitor repayment schedules and default events
- Access borrower communications and servicer notices
- Securely store and fetch off-chain PII and financial data

## The Loan Lifecycle on LQDTY

Each loan progresses through a well-defined set of on-chain states:

1. **Application Submission** → Borrower initiates the process
2. **Document Collection & Verification** → For due diligence
3. **Underwriting** → Risk and terms assessment
4. **Collateral Management** → Request, deposit, and approve
5. **Loan Disbursement** → Funds are released on-chain
6. **Repayment Initiation & Tracking** → Repayment schedule begins
7. **Closure / Default Handling** → Based on repayment performance

At every stage, API endpoints facilitate state transitions and update relevant metadata in a role-based, secure manner.

## NFT-Based Loan Representation

The LQDTY protocol uses two non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent loan positions:

- **Loan Obligation NFT**: Non-transferable, issued to the borrower as a digital representation of the loan agreement and repayment responsibility.
- **Lender Certificate NFT**: Transferable, issued to the lender and representing rights to future cash flows — enabling secondary market trades or securitization.

This dual-token system ensures compliance, transparency, and liquidity for all stakeholders.

## Data Architecture

Our system separates loan data into three categories:

- **On-Chain**: Loan state, principal, interest, repayment status, NFTs, and lifecycle transitions
- **Off-Chain (Non-PII)**: Metadata, repayment history, contract terms (hashed or plaintext)
- **Off-Chain (PII)**: Borrower details, contact information, employment history — encrypted and securely stored

## Key Features

- 📄 **Role-Based Access**: Granular control for lenders, servicers, and borrowers
- 🔐 **Secure PII Handling**: PII is encrypted using Bearer-token access
- 🔁 **Programmable Workflows**: Every loan stage can be advanced via API calls
- 📊 **Verifiable On-Chain State**: Lifecycle states are tamper-proof and audit-friendly
- 🛠️ **Developer Friendly**: Consistent endpoint design and payload schemas
